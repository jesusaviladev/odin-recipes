    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>2 ½ cups lukewarm water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as P.A.N.®)</li>
      <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in
        cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist,
        malleable dough.
      </li>
      <li>Overhead of white dough in a glass bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten
        into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty. Overhead of eight flattened, circular
        dough shapes placed on a baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches
        until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked
        arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to
        handle. Overhead of four arepas cooking on a skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife
        to form a pita-like pocket. Overhead of five arepas being sliced in half
        by a knife on a cutting board.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
